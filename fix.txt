1) In function `calculateFederalTax`: Fixed incorrect application of tax brackets. 
   Changed: if (income > 100000) { rate = 0.22 } 
   To: if (income > 100000 && income <= 200000) { rate = 0.22 }

2) In function `calculateDeductions`: Applied additional $5,000 deduction for joint filers.
   Added logic to check filing status and apply extra deduction for joint filers.

3) In function `calculateStateTax`: Fixed incorrect application of flat 5% tax rate after deductions.
   Changed: stateTax = taxableIncome * 0.05
   To: stateTax = Math.max(0, taxableIncome * 0.05)
